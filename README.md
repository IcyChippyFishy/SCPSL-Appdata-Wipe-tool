# SCPSL Appdata Folder Wipe Tool

A simple open-source batch utility to wipe the SCP: Secret Laboratory
AppData folder in order to fix issues with the Mistaken Client.

## What does this do?
This tool deletes the following folder for the CURRENT Windows user:

C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\SCP Secret Laboratory

This helps fix:
- Mistaken Client connection issues
- Central server bugs
- Client conflicts between normal SCPSL and Mistaken

Also make sure to back up `keybinding.txt` before wiping.
You would lose all your keybinds XD
